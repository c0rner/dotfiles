# TMUX - Session builder; https://github.com/c0rner/dotfiles
#
# Installation and setup
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Copy this file ".tmux_session" to your $HOME and create ".tmux_session.local"
# where you define your sessions using shell funtions. Look at the "example"
# function in this file (it has been commented out)
#
# Set up new bindings, for example ctrl+c and ctrl+s, to launch sessions:
# > bind ^c command-prompt -p "Name:" "new-window '~/.tmux_session %1 --no-session'"
# > bind ^s command-prompt -p "Name:" "new-session -s '%1' '~/.tmux_session %1'"

# Configuration
TMUX=$(which tmux)

# Launch command in new window
# Arg1: Window name
# Arg2: Command
# Defines: $win for reference
commw() {
   win=$(${TMUX} neww -Pd -n "$1" "$2")

   # Fix instance where window_index is returned with pane-id (seen in 1.8)
   win=${win%.*}
}

# Launch shell in new window and run command
# Arg1: Window name
# Arg2: Command
# Defines: $win for reference
shellw() {
   local command=$2
   commw $1
   [ -n "${command}" ] && command="${command} C-m"
   ${TMUX} send-keys -t "$win" "$2"
}

# Launch command in new pane
# Arg1: Target window/pane
# Arg2: Command
# Arg3: Flags (optional)
# Defines: $pane for reference
commp() {
   local target=$1
   local cmd=$2
   shift 2
   pane=$(${TMUX} split-window $@ -Pdt "$target" "$cmd")
}

# Launch shell in new pane and run command
# Arg1: Target window/pane
# Arg2: Command
# Arg3: Flags (optional)
# Defines: $pane for reference
shellp() {
   local target=$1
   local command=$2
   shift 2
   pane=$(${TMUX} split-window $@ -Pdt "${target}")
   [ -n "${command}" ] && command="${command} C-m"
   ${TMUX} send-keys -t "${pane}" "${command}"
}

## Example session setup

#   commw CommandWindow "top"
#   shellp $win "ls -l"
#   shellp $pane "id" "-h -p 30"
#   commp $pane "watch date" "-p 40"
#
#   # Set up key bindings
#   ${TMUX} bind A send-keys "echo Hello"
